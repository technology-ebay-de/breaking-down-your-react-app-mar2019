                This is what every developer loves to have when starting a new project: a nice green field,
                everything is possible, the magical chance to get things right this time. To use state-of-the-art
                technology, to build something beautiful that will stand the test of time.
                And, of course, make the customers very, very happy.

                So, tadaa, our first release. It’s all good, software craftsmanship at its best. Servers running
                smoothly, high code coverage, only a few bugs and loose ends.

                understand what’s going on in the code. We should fix that! And fix it we will! Eventually! When
                we’re done with the next release, or perhaps the one after that, because rolling out those new
                features is super important!

                OK, now the developers are fixing some of the problems, but it’s starting to look more and more
                like we’re just fire fighting, patching up what actually should be torn down and rebuilt from
                scratch.<br><br>
                In the many years I’ve been working as a software developer, I’ve seen this happen time and time
                again. There’s nothing I’m quite as passionate about as finding ways to prevent this phenomenon

                Software Entropy.<br><br>
                While software is actively being worked on, its complexity is constantly increasing, technical
                debt is accumulated, the software becomes harder and harder to modify without breaking things. At
                some point, the cost of fixing it is higher than the cost of rewriting it from scratch.

                To prevent this, you have to refactor your code base periodically. It’s not just about fixing
                bugs, it’s about keeping your code clean, about making it consistent.<br><br>
                It’s OK to make some debt, but you have to make sure you have recurring phases of paying off that
                debt, lest it become too great and make cleaning up too costly.

                So what does all that have to do with React?<br><br>
                What makes React so special to me is that it is based on components. You break down your
                application into neat little parts and work on them separately. You compose your application from
                building blocks, like Lego bricks.

            <aside class="notes">
                If you use React right, you can create a set of loosely coupled components, with well defined
                purpose

            <aside class="notes">
                You can use that set of building blocks to build your pages. You can work on each component
                separately, you can even split them into independent npm packages and versionize them.

                If a part of your application needs to be extended or renewed, you can throw away the old
                components and replace them with shiny, new ones. In the pre-component age, with a tightly
                coupled, monolithic application, this was expensive and time consuming, much less now.<br><br>
                React gives us the chance to make this dream come true, but it does not come automatically

                Just because you are using React doesn’t mean you a clean, well structured codebase
                automatically. You can create a “big ball of mud" with React just as well as you can with jQuery
                or anything else.
