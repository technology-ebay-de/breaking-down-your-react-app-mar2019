                This is what every developer loves to have when starting a new project: a nice green field,
                everything is possible, the magical chance to get things right this time. To use state-of-the-art
                technology, to build something beautiful that will stand the test of time.
                And, of course, make the customers very, very happy.

                So, tadaa, our first release. It’s all good, software craftsmanship at its best. Servers running
                smoothly, high code coverage, only a few bugs and loose ends.

                And some more… but what’s this? Bug rate is increasing? It’s getting harder and harder to
                understand what’s going on in the code. We should fix that! And fix it we will! Eventually! When
                we’re done with the next release, or perhaps the one after that, because rolling out those new
                features is super important!

                OK, now the developers are fixing some of the problems, but it’s starting to look more and more
                like we’re just fire fighting, patching up what actually should be torn down and rebuilt from
                scratch.<br><br>
                In the many years I’ve been working as a software developer, I’ve seen this happen time and time
                again. There’s nothing I’m quite as passionate about as finding ways to prevent this phenomenon
                known as:

                Software Entropy.<br><br>
                While software is actively being worked on, its complexity is constantly increasing, technical
                debt is accumulated, the software becomes harder and harder to modify without breaking things. At
                some point, the cost of fixing it is higher than the cost of rewriting it from scratch.

                To prevent this, you have to refactor your code base periodically. It’s not just about fixing
                bugs, it’s about keeping your code clean, about making it consistent.<br><br>
                It’s OK to make some debt, but you have to make sure you have recurring phases of paying off that
                debt, lest it become too great and make cleaning up too costly.
